Que 1- What is use of Gitignore File in React Application ?
Ans 1- In a React application (or any software project), the .gitignore file is used to specify intentionally untracked files or
       directories that Git should ignore. These files are usually temporary or generated files, build artifacts, or sensitive information
       that shouldn't be included in the version control system. The purpose of the .gitignore file is to prevent these files from being
       inadvertently committed to the Git repository.

Que 2- How we can create the React Application? Explain the all Steps for them.
Ans 2- Creating a React application involves several steps, and the most common way to set up a new React project is by using the official
       tool called Create React App. This tool provides a zero-configuration setup, allowing you to focus on building your React application
       rather than configuring the build process. 

       Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
       Step 2: Install Create React App
               Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install 'Create React App'
       Step 3: Create a New React Application
               Once Create React App is installed, you can create a new React application using the following command.
               Replace my-react-app with the desired name of your project:
       Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory
               (cd my-react-app)
       Step 5: Run the Development Server (npm start)

Que 3- What do you know about NPM ?
Ans 3- NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and JavaScript. It is used to manage and share packages (libraries) of JavaScript code,
       making it easy for developers to reuse and distribute code. NPM plays a crucial role in the Node.js ecosystem and is widely used in both
       frontend and backend development.

Que 4- What are the advantages of using React ?
Ans 4- React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, offers several advantages that contribute to its popularity and widespread adoption.
       Here are some key advantages of using React:

       1: Component-Based Architecture:
          React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to build complex UIs by composing small, modular, and reusable components.
          This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

       2: Virtual DOM:
          Instead of updating the entire DOM when there's a change, React creates a virtual representation of the DOM in memory and updates
          only the necessary parts.

       3: JSX (JavaScript XML):
          JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML within JavaScript code. It provides a concise and readable
          way to define UI components, making the code more expressive and maintainable.

Que 5- What are the limitations of React ?
Ans 5- Here are some limitations of react :

       1. React is just a library. It is not a complete framework.
       2. It has a huge library which takes time to understand.
       3. It may be difficult for the new programmers to understand and code.
       4. React uses inline templating and JSX, which may be difficult and act as a barrier.
